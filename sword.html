	<h3>Soul-Piercing Sword</h3>
	<p>Some ghosts, especially those who have been on the earth for an extended period of time, know how to resist the power of hopelessness and false hope alike. But to us, this is little more than a bump in the road. A few slashes and stabbings with this neat weapon exposes every vulnerable area within the spirit, re-opening every source of pain the poltergeist has experienced in his or her life. Their emotional state disordered with a myriad of different sources of agony, they become easy pickings for one of our other devices.</p>
