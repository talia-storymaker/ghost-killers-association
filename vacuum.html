	<h3>Vacuum of Despair</h3>
	<p>This highly effective device is all we need for the majority of haunting issues. It simply creates a nigh-irrestible vacuum to slurp up any spiritual being. Its exact mechanisms are complicated, but to put it simply, it utilizes an amazing power source: the despair of death. Ghosts remain on earth trying to accomplish something they were unable to do in life, but this nifty gadget tears open a hole in their soul, exposing the hopelessness of this endeavor. Utterly enervated, they are compelled by the vacuum's suction to embrace either total nonexistence or eternal torment within the confines of the machine's body. Either way, we can guarantee they'll never, ever bother you again!</p>
